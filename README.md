# AAPL-Stock_Market_Prediction

This project aims to predict the stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using a deep learning model called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that has proven to be successful in time-series forecasting, making it ideal for stock market prediction.
The project will involve the collection and preprocessing of historical stock price data for AAPL from reliable sources, such as Yahoo Finance. This data will be used to train the LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
